## Open Questions
- [ ] What order should seats appear in the Full Seat Summaries PDF? (org hierarchy? alphabetical?)
- [ ] Should there be a cover page or table of contents?
- [ ] Should empty sections (no measurables, no rocks, etc.) be hidden or shown with placeholder text?
- [ ] Does "Process/Playbook Inventory" map to existing data in the system, or is this a new field?
