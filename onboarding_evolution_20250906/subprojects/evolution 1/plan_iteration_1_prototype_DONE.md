# Plan - Iteration 1: Prototype

## Goal
Build partial. Show partial. Get Scott approval.

## Steps

1. Create `_onboard_account_owners.html.erb` with 5 cards (About You + dynamic flow)
2. Add query string check to show it (`/today/dashboard?onboarding=true` for testing only; final gating will use a database field)
3. Review with Scott
4. Iterate based on feedback

## Access
`/today/dashboard?onboarding=true` (temporary QA toggle)
