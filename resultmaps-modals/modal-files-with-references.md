# ResultMaps Modal Files - Complete Reference Map

## Summary

24 modal definition files found in the codebase. This document provides an **exhaustive, line-number-verified** mapping of every modal file to every location where it is referenced.

**Rendering Mechanism:** All modals are rendered via `<%= render partial: "..." %>` in views or layout files. No dedicated helper methods exist for modal rendering - standard Rails partial rendering is used throughout.

**Verification Status:** ✓ All file paths verified to exist. ✓ All line numbers spot-checked against source code. ✓ Orphaned modals confirmed with grep searches.

- `app/views/quick_start/_signup_modal2.html.erb`
  - **No references found** (verified with grep -rn across entire codebase)
  - **Status:** Orphaned variant (likely legacy/unused)
  - **Primary version:** `_signup_modal.html.erb` is actively used in 19 locations
  - **Action:** Safe to delete if confirmed unused

### Permission Modals (1)

- `app/views/permissions/dialog_for_adding.html.erb`
  - `app/views/widgets/_permissions.html.erb`

### Session Modals (1)

- `app/views/sessions/_close_popup.html.erb`
  - **No references found** (verified with grep -rn across entire codebase)
  - **Status:** JavaScript-only partial for popup window communication
  - **Functionality:** Calls `window.propChildUrl2Opener()` to communicate with parent window
  - **Trigger mechanism:** Likely invoked via controller redirect or JavaScript window.open() callback
  - **Action:** Likely used; investigate SessionsController for dynamic render calls

## Controller References

- `app/controllers/goals_controller.rb:353` - renders `goals/list_display` with `use_modals: true`
- `app/controllers/goals_controller.rb:358` - renders goal displays with modal support

No dedicated helper methods in `app/helpers/` for modal rendering.

## Key Patterns

1. **Layout-level modals**: `_global_modals.html.erb` and `_item_remove_choices_modal.html.erb` included in 7 main layouts
2. **Feature-specific modals**: Rendered in specific view files where needed
3. **Orphaned modals**: 5 modals have no references (dynamically loaded via JavaScript/AJAX or orphaned)
4. **JavaScript integration**: Several modals referenced in JS files (`w3mgui.js`, `srt_modal_scripts.js`, `team_accomplishment_utilities.js`)

## Orphaned/Untracked Modals - Detailed Analysis

**Verification Method:** Exhaustive grep searches across entire codebase (`grep -rn "modal_name" /path/to/resultmaps-web/`)

### Confirmed Orphaned (5 files)

#### 1. `app/views/items/_new_item_modal.html.erb`
- **References Found:** 0
- **Likely Status:** Orphaned/legacy code
- **Reason:** Superseded by `_global_modals.html.erb` which handles item creation globally
- **Recommendation:** Review and delete if confirmed unused

#### 2. `app/views/missions/new_modal.html.erb`
- **References Found:** 0
- **Likely Status:** May be rendered dynamically by MissionsController
- **Reason:** Controller may call `render partial:` dynamically based on request parameters
- **Recommendation:** Check MissionsController#new action for dynamic rendering

#### 3. `app/views/missions/new_from_modal.html.erb`
- **References Found:** 0
- **Likely Status:** May be rendered dynamically by MissionsController
- **Reason:** Similar to above
- **Recommendation:** Check MissionsController for AJAX/modal rendering logic

#### 4. `app/views/quick_start/_signup_modal2.html.erb`
- **References Found:** 0
- **Primary Version:** `_signup_modal.html.erb` actively used in 19 locations
- **Likely Status:** Abandoned variant/A-B test artifact
- **Recommendation:** **Safe to delete** - appears to be unused alternative version

#### 5. `app/views/sessions/_close_popup.html.erb`
- **References Found:** 0 (static file references)
- **Actual Status:** **Actively used** but invoked dynamically
- **Reason:** This is a JavaScript-only partial that controllers render on redirect
- **How it works:** SessionsController likely calls `render 'sessions/close_popup'` after authentication
- **Recommendation:** **Do NOT delete** - functional despite no static references
