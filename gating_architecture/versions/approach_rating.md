# Approach Self-Assessment

## Rating Criteria (1-10 scale)

### 1. Ease of Implementation: **6/10**

**Strengths:**
- Uses existing methods (`active_stripe_subscription`, `is_pro_plan?`)
- No database changes needed
- Can start with one-liner checks

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern 2 requires adding new methods to models
- Feature flag constants need to be defined and maintained
- May need to touch multiple controllers

### 2. Ease of Maintenance: **5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Centralized feature lists in constants
- Clear method names (`has_feature?`)

**Weaknesses:**
- Feature flags scattered across constants and case statements
- Two places to update when adding features (FEATURE_GATES + case statement)
- No single source of truth for what features exist
- Hard-coded plan checks (`is_pro_plan?`) throughout codebase

### 3. Speed of Implementation: **7/10**

**Strengths:**
- Quick Win example can be implemented in minutes
- Pattern 1 requires zero infrastructure changes

**Weaknesses:**
- Full implementation requires touching multiple files
- Testing needed for each gated feature

## Aggregate Score: **6/10**

**This is NOT a 9 or higher.**

## Critical Issues with My Approach:

1. **Over-engineered for the ask** - You wanted "simplest" but I provided 3 patterns and multi-step implementations

2. **Maintenance burden** - The feature flag approach creates technical debt with constants that need updating

3. **Not DRY** - Case statements and constants duplicate feature knowledge

## What Would Make This a 9/10:

### The ACTUAL Simplest Solution:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb - ONE method
def can_access_premium_feature?
  return true if is_system_admin?
  return true if SKIP_PROMPT_USER_IDS.include?(id)
  
  subscription = active_stripe_subscription
  return false unless subscription
  
  # Just check if they have ANY active subscription
  subscription.subscription_status == 'active'
end
```

### Use it anywhere:
```ruby
# In controller
unless current_user.can_access_premium_feature?
  redirect_to upgrade_path
end

# In view
<% if current_user.can_access_premium_feature? %>
  <!-- Show feature -->
<% end %>
```

**That's it.** 
- One method
- One place to maintain
- 5 minutes to implement
- Uses existing infrastructure

This would be a **9/10** for simplicity.
