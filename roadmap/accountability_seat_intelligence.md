This project will be built out based on this claude discussion (that merits triple checking for accuracy)

You're absolutely right to question this! Looking at the code, the EOS seat assignment is conditional and not automatic. Here's what
  actually happens:

  Actual EOS Seat Assignment Behavior

  In app/models/setup.rb (lines 51-69), when Setup.choose_persona is called:
  
  #BEGIN CHAT HISTORY
<chat history>
  1. IF framework == 'eos' AND
  2. IF persona_code == 6 (CEO/Visionary) → looks for existing 'Visionary' seat
  3. OR IF persona_code == 7 (Integrator) → looks for existing 'Integrator' seat
  4. THEN it tries to assign the user to that seat

  The Key Condition: Seats Must Already Exist

  seat = group.active_seats.detect{|seat| seat.name == seat_name}
  seat[:accountability_owner_id] = user.id  # Only if seat found

  The code does NOT create seats - it only assigns the user to an existing seat if found. The seats would need to be created separately
  through:
  - Group#create_default_eos_seats method
  - Coach building a client with EOS framework
  - Admin enabling EOS for an account

  So my original statement was incorrect

  The correct behavior is:
  - CEO/Visionary (6) and Integrator (7) personas get assigned to their respective EOS seats IF those seats already exist
  - No seats are automatically created during the persona selection process
  - The seat assignment happens silently in a rescue block, so if seats don't exist, nothing happens

  This is an important distinction for our onboarding evolution - we might want to consider whether seats should be created
  automatically or if we need to guide users to create them first.

> You make interesting points, but this is a distraction that will both waste time toward achieving my success, criteria and risk 
  alienating users, who refused to wait for the database calls. The correct place to think about this is on first load of the 
  accountability chart for any given user who is the account owner. this merits it's on project in vibe_coding, and entry (as an .md file)
   in the vibe_coding/roadmap project
