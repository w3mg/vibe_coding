**Notes:**
- This multi-office V/TO structure is Example Air's adaptation—EOS guides don't address companies this size and neither endorse nor prohibit cascading V/TOs by division.
- **1-Year Goals:** The source data included "Goals For The Year" in 1-Year Plans. This has been excluded pending confirmation of correct EOS terminology.
- **Measurables:** Per pure EOS, "Measurables" is a text field listing what metrics to track—not specific target values. The source data included values; this document shows lists only.
