# Front End POC Success Criteria

1. Simple code that conforms to our Code Complete guidelines.  Ask for that path if you cannot find the code complete guidelines
2. Provide a clean, simple visual with minimal formatting of the data that ties things together 
3. if using a plugin or library be lightweight
4. File must open directly in browser - no server
5. use something modern that looks good, not like a 1990s flow chart

#NOTES
- react or jquery based
- we currently use bootstrap and d3, these are ok also
